# mips_pipeline
Subset implementation of a 5-state pipelined MIPS datapath. Built and simulated using [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) and a few modules from the [versatile library](https://opencores.org/projects/versatile_library) from open cores.

Done as a mini-project for a university course on computer architecture.
